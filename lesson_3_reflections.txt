When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  In case I want to collabrate with other people. or I want my code to go public and maintain the changes in one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  because this may add unwanted changes to the code in the local machine that you are working on, which might cuze a conflict in the two versions.
