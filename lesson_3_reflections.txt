Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  In case I want to collabrate with other people. or I want my code to go public and maintain the changes in one place.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  because this may add unwanted changes to the code in the local machine that you are working on.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  fork make a clone from a repository in github, while maintaing a refrence to the owner of the repository.
  clone make a copy of the repository to the local machine.
  branch commits changes to a diffrent direction than the one before branching, therefore new commits will be saved in the new branch.
